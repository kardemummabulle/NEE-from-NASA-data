This R script was developed and used for paper in Nature Communications: Karlsson, J., Serikova, S., Vorobyev, S.N. et al. Carbon emission from Western Siberian inland waters. Nat Commun 12, 825 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21054-1

Net ecosystem exchange extraction from NASA SMAP L4 Global Daily 9 km EASE-Grid Carbon Net Ecosystem Exchange, Version 4 product 39 (https://nsidc.org/data/SPL4CMDL). This product provides global gridded (9 × 9 km) daily estimates of NEE (CO2) derived using satellite data based on terrestrial C flux model informed by Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band microwave observations, land cover and vegetation inputs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, and the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 land model assimilation system. Note that NEE detects only terrestrial vegetation and ignores aquatic surfaces.
